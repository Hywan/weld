# `weld`

`weld` is an attempt to write a linker.

In Arabic, it means “son”, like son of `ld`, `lld`, `gold` and `mold`. It's
also a good name for a linker, because it melds things together. Finally, it's
also a pun with “we”-`ld`, like _we_ do a linker together, but I'm just alone
for the moment (_face holding back tears_).
