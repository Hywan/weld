The provided target triple binary format is not supported.

`weld` uses a target triple to guess which linker strategy to use based on
the target binary format. For example the target `x86_64-unknown-linux`
represents a system that uses Elf for its object files, or
`aarch64-apple-darwin` uses MachO, and so on.

It appears that the provided target triple maps to a binary format that `weld`
does not seem to support for two possible reasons:

1. Either `weld` does not support this binary format at all yet,
2. Either `weld` has not been compiled with this binary format support.
